        <p>
          Help सेतु is a help portal website designed to empower local residents in India to report various social issues such as child labor, domestic violence, lack of child education, elder neglect, missing persons, injured or distressed animals, roadkill, corruption, violence, and violations of regulations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our mission is to provide a platform for people, by people, to address social issues effectively. We facilitate timely and effective interventions by relaying reported information to relevant authorities such as the police, NGOs, hospitals, and other organizations.
